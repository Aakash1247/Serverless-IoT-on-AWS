Troubleshooting ESP8266 and ESP32 connection issues.


1.  Make sure you are on a 2.4GHz network not 5GHz, the device only communicates at 2.4GHz

2.  Make sure port 8883 isn't being blocked by your network admin, this is the port that MQTT(s) traditionally communicates on

3.  Make sure your onboard device certificates match your AWS IoT Core region, the x509 should be fungible between regions

4.  If you aren't receiving your devices payload under your subscription topic in AWS IoT Core in the "test" tab, then go to the "Monitor" tab
 and see if your device is even connecting.  Often a device is actually connecting, but the payload isn't being received, the reason for this 
 is usually a problem with your device certificates.  The device will connect but the payload wont pass through if your device certificates
 aren't exactly correct.
